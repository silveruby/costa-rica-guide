	- Gavilana or Jackass bitters (Neurolaena lobata) is derived from a plant resembling ragweed that grows in northwestern South American through Central America and into southern Mexico as well as islands in the Caribbean. It can reach up to six feet in height, and as the name suggests, all parts of the plant have a bitter taste. In the areas where it grows, native people have used jackass bitters to treat cancer, diabetes, dysentery and malaria.

The stem of the palm tree is harvested and the bark is removed leaving a layer of white fiber around the central core. This fiber is removed leaving the center core of the heart of palm which is eaten. The fresh hearts of palm tend to be crisp and crunchy whereas the canned hearts of palm lose their crunchiness and are much softer.
